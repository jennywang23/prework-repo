**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Jenny Wang**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://intriguing-gravel-smelt.glitch.me)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [none]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [One of the challenges I encountered in creating this submission was get using to the syntax of the coding languages used. I had never
   coded using HTML, CSS, or JavaScript before so I had to spend some time getting used to it. I overcame this challenge by taking some
   time to look over the information about the languages on the project walkthrough page. I also was just able to get more used to coding
   in the languages while completing the project. Something else that was a challenge for me was keeping track of all of the different
   elements that go into making a website, like the format, colors, sound, and shapes. It was a little difficult for me because I didn't have
   much experience with web design before creating this game website. I was able to overcome this challenge by slowing working
   through the individual elements that make up a website and taking the time to understand each part. One more thing that I struggled with 
   a little bit was the organization of the code into the three separate files. I found myself having to take some time to think through 
   which file certain functions should belong to. I was able to overcome this challenge just by taking some time to get used to the 
   organization of the files. It became a lot easier once I got further into the project.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [One question I have about web development is "What are the limits when it comes to developing a website?" With this memory game website, 
   we were just scratching the surface of what can be incorporated into a website and I feel like there is so much that is possible when 
   creating websites that I have never thought of doing before. But, with all of the possiblities in web development, there 
   probably are also things that are not yet possible. I would like to learn more about the problems that have yet to be solved in web design 
   and how programmers are currently working to develop solutions for these problems."]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would probably spend them trying to implement more of the optional functions, like 
   making more functional buttons and playing around with the layout and aesthetic of the web page more. Something else that I would have been 
   really interested in implementing is having the appearances of the buttons change more when clicked on, outside of the color changing. I would 
   have wanted to try experimenting with a shape change or adding an image on top of the button. Something related to the appearance of the web page
   that I would have wanted to experiment with is adding a moving image on the screen. I would have also wanted to implement things that would 
   change the game play, like making the player have a certain number of guesses or a limited amount of time to complete each round. One more 
   thing that I would've wanted to try implementing is having a quiet intense music playing in the background while the game was being played. 
   I think that this would have been cool to implement as it would add a sense of suspense throughout the game and add to the experience.]
